1)first step is to package the application as a JAR file:
- ./mvnw clean package -DskipTests

after this, in /target/ folder, we can see Jar file library-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

2.1)then we can build out docker image
docker build -t ada/midterm .

2.2)or, we can use docker-compose. in docker-compose.yml we defined both spring boot app, and database.
- docker-compose build
- docker-compose up

now we can make requests to localhost:8080/
